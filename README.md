# Superliminal
Superliminal is a digital signage solution designed to provide private and commercial users with a cost effective, customizable, and always-on solution for viewing images on a TV.


## Key Features
  * **Simple User Interface** - 
  Superliminal's web interface allows for easy setup without requiring the user to access command line interfaces.  During startup a keyboard may be used to access a setup page, where all of Superliminal's options are accessible.
  * **Dropbox Integration** - 
  Easily connect a Dropbox account (other cloud services planned for the future) to effortlessly update signage materials.
  * **Remote Management** - 
    - **LAN Web Browser** - 
    Often the hardware used to drive digital signage is mounted in a difficult to access location.  For network enabled installations, Superliminal offers configuration via a web browser (similar to setting up a router).  Superliminal's options are protected by a customizable password.
    - **Hotspot** - 
    If enabled by the user, Superliminal can respond to an inaccessible local network by defaulting to an access point.  The SSID and (WPA) passphrase for the hotspot are configurable by the user.  The user can then connect to hardware running Superliminal like any other wireless network, allowing for remote management through a web browser.  This is designed to eliminate the cumbersome need to directly access signage hardware.
